# why c# is object oriented programming language

* because it have class and object 
* it support encapsulation ,abstraction ,polimorphism ,Inheritance
* method overriding 
* method overloading
* c# language is oop based because main method in class 


## Encapsulation
* it wrap the data in in private method . so data is hidden 
* bind your data together, data hiding members => not accessible from outside by default all members are private

## Abstraction
* only show necessary information to specific user is called abstraction
* providing functionalities to the users and hiding interal detail abstradt keyword , interface*


## Polimorphism
* compile time(method overloading) - same method name and different argument  and run time(method overiding) 



## Inheritance
* here one calss can inherited in another parent calss for example Animal is parent calss and cow is child class
* every animal can eat. cow can also eat*
* had five type
* single
* multiple
* mulit-level
* hirarchical
* hybrid


# what is class
* user define data type
*  states and behaviors
	* blue print of data

# object 
* instanse of a class
